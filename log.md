### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on codepen and coded a designed layout by Ghani Pradita 
**Thoughts** It took alot of dedication and hard work because of the buttons on bottom mixing in with the chat box and close. It was a fun layout to code and it's my first on here so I'm pretty excited on the future layouts that I will code.
